The man we're going to meet.

He wants to tell you in person.
He was on Ziegler Five a few months ago.

It's not all that bad.
The air's fresh, though it smells different.

- Nothing.

One more thing:
If you open the door, it registers on the computer.

These are circuit integrators.

There were many activist groups. But the only one
that really meant anything was led by Roj Blake.

We were outlawed and hunted.

You were captured. So were most of our followers.

But that would have given the cause a martyr.

So instead they put you into intensive therapy.

They erased areas of your mind,
they implanted new ideas.

91
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,760
They literally took your mind to pieces and rebuilt it.

92
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:33,560
And when they'd finished, you confessed.
You said you'd been "misguided".

You appealed to everyone to support the Administration,
hound out the traitors.

They did a good job on you.
You were very convincing.

Then they took you back and erased even that.

00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,960
We've done psych readings which show that
a high percentage of people believe

148
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,400
that Blake's trial was a showpiece
and his statements were rigged.

149
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,840
His death could be used by the dissidents.
They need a hero Alive or dead, Blake could be it.

150
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:17,720
Difficult. I suppose my department could infect him,
some rapidly terminal disease.

151
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,280
Would his natural death help?

152
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,520
I don't think so.

153
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:29,520
We need to discredit him.
He could be deported to Cygnus Alpha.

154
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,960
Doctor, am I right in thinking you can create
experiences in a subject

155
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,200
who will then believe that they really happened?

156
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,760
Of course.
Creating an illusion of reality is quite simple.

157
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,480
Good. Then I think we can totally destroy
Blake's credibility and get him sentenced.

158
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,800
But I'd like to do a feasibility check.
Doctor, would you come with me please?

159
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,320
As you wish.

160
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,760
- I want to bring charges soon, Morag.
- I shall report back.

161
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,320
- You heard?
- I heard.

162
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,680
Satisfied?

163
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,000
Not yet. He can identify me.
My whole operation is at risk.

164
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,520
I'll be satisfied when the risk is eliminated.

165
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,720
[BLAKE'S VOICE ECHOING]
Remember. Remember.

166
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,880
Varon. Come in.

167
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,720
Do sit down.
Thank you.

168
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,120
- You know Morag, don't you?
- Yes.

169
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,880
Varon...

170
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,200
...I've got a defence assignment for you.
Not a very pleasant one, I'm afraid.

171
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,720
Morag is prosecuting.

172
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,800
The evidence is indisputable If I were you,
I should concentrate on the mitigation.

173
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,040
Mm.

174
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,840
Varon, I'm going to say this because
I feel so very strongly about this case.

175
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,840
I want you to do everything in your power
to help the man. Our first concern must be justice.

176
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:37,840
Public address:
Security clear on cell unit M 3
for Justice Department access.

177
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:58,560
I'm Tel Varon, Justice Department.
I've been assigned to defend you.

178
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,440
- I don't need a defence. I'm going to plead guilty.
- Come now. The evidence against you is strong.

179
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,320
I just want to make a statement in open court.
I want those responsible for the massacre brought to trial.

180
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,840
I'm sorry?

181
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,720
There can be no justification for deliberate murder.
There's nothing in the charges about murder.

182
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,640
There are a number of other counts Assault on a minor,
attempting to corrupt minors, moral deviation.

183
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,160
Let me see that!

184
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:42,240
All involving children! None of this is true!
That's why you pleading guilty surprises me.

185
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,720
Well, yes, but not to this, not to these charges.

186
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,200
They are the only charges against you. And frankly
the evidence against you is very damaging.

187
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,920
- Well, if there is any evidence, it's been faked!
- I've had the opportunity of talking to the children...

188
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,960
that is, the prosecution witnesses;
and they do seem very certain of their facts.

189
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,600
Oh, yes, yes.
Their briefing would have been perfect.

190
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,440
- I'll outline how I think we should conduct your case.
- They set me up beautifully.

191
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,240
There is a possible approach if we could cite your record:

192
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,080
Your breakdown after your involvement
with those illegal political groups,

193
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,240
the remorse and guilt that you felt
has placed you under an enormous strain.

194
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,040
We can submit that these assaults were
carried out whilst you were mentally unbalanced.

195
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,080
I will offer no defence, but I will plead not guilty.

196
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,880
These are grave charges.
You might face deportation.

197
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:42,040
A mental institution would be better than
spending the rest of your life on Cygnus Alpha.

198
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,640
I will offer no defence. Right?

199
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,440
Won't you reconsider?

200
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:55,600
Even if you could prove me innocent, the charges
have been made. I've got to hand it to them.

201
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,240
You've done a brilliant job!!

202
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,080
Good morning.

203
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,240
I've had a chance to think things through.

204
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,200
It's vital that I have the opportunity to make
that statement to the open court.

205
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,560
Well that�s up to the Arbiter.
It's not usual.

206
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,520
There's no way you can
prove my innocence, is there?

207
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,400
You've given me no chance to try.

208
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,920
IS THERE?

209
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,680
It is doubtful.

210
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,600
- I AM innocent.
- I've spoken to the children.

211
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,200
Their statements were all verified by a lie detector.
And that puts them beyond dispute.

212
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,760
The Administration has gone to enormous trouble.
They've even put themselves at risk.

213
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,640
There must be a number of people involved who know
the truth. Why would they take that chance?

214
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,960
There's no possible reason that I can think of.

215
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:13,680
I know you've heard the evidence but,
just for the moment, assume that I am innocent.

216
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,240
All right.

217
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:22,040
At first, I thought they wanted to silence me because
I was the only witness to the murder of twenty people.

218
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,600
If they're as ruthless as you suggest,
then why didn't they simply eliminate you?

219
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,040
Because I was something of a political figure;
or so you told me.

220
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,160
You had a considerable following,

221
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,320
but then you publicly denounced your whole
movement and pledged support to the Administration.

222
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,800
There are those who secretly believe
you were coerced into that statement.

223
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,800
Exactly!
And my death would merely reinforce those beliefs.

224
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,480
It's exactly the same as if I were arraigned
for being at a proscribed political meeting.

225
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,680
So they trump up these charges against me.

226
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,800
If it were true, do you realise the
implications of what you're saying?

227
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,680
It would mean corruption at a
high level of the Administration.

228
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,640
Public address:
Now be silent.

229
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,120
By the authority of the Terran Federation,
this tribunal is in session.

230
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,880
The Arbiter will permit submissions.

231
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,040
Let the accused be brought forward.

232
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,320
Have you, the accused, been made aware of the
charges that are laid against you?

233
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,000
Do you fully understand the nature
and gravity of those charges?

234
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,120
Yes.

235
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,000
- Who speaks for the Federation?
- I do.

236
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
- Who speaks for the accused?
- I do.

237
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,920
Are you both satisfied that the
evidence was fairly obtained?

238
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,320
And that all statements were certified as
true and correct by lie detector?

239
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,160
I am.

240
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,240
Is the accused satisfied that his defence has been
fully and fairly prepared?

241
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,920
The charges against me are totally false.
I am not guilty therefore I offer no defence.

242
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:36,800
Your guilt or innocence is what we are here
to determine. The case will be examined.

243
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,760
Let it be seen that the evidence for the prosecution
is sealed and approved by the defence.

244
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,080
Let it be seen that the evidence for the defence
is sealed and approved by the prosecution.

245
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,880
Let the matter be assessed and may justice prevail.

246
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,280
The accused has been found
guilty on all charges.

247
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:46,040
His crimes have been accorded a Category 9 rating,
and as such are adjudged most grave.

248
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,000
In sentencing you, the judgment machine has
taken into account your past record,

249
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,000
your service to the state,
and your loyalty to the Federation.

250
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,680
None of these have mitigated in your favour.

251
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,320
It is the sentence of this tribunal that you be taken
from this place to an area of close confinement.

252
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,520
From there you will be transported to the
penal colony on the planet Cygnus Alpha,

253
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,240
where you will remain
for the rest of your natural life.

254
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,920
This matter is ended

255
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,040
I wish to make a statement.

256
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,400
There can be no more said regarding this case.
Assessment and judgment have been made.

257
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,760
But the evidence is false.
These charges are lies!

258
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,600
If you have any complaint against the conduct
of this tribunal, it must be directed through your advocate.

259
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,960
You've got to listen to me!

260
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,160
Voice of Bran Foster:
They erased areas of your mind,
they implanted new ideas.

261
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,680
They literally took your mind
to pieces and rebuilt it.

262
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,080
When they finished, they put you up and you confessed.
You said you'd been 'misguided'.

263
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,560
You appealed to everyone to support the
Administration, hound out the traitors.

264
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,600
They did a good job on you.
You were very convincing.

265
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,080
And then they took you back
and erased even that.

266
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,480
Let me go! Let me go! No! No!

267
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,000
Take it easy! I hate personal violence,
especially when I'm the person.

268
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,200
- Who are you?
- I'm Vila Restal.

269
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,600
- Where are we?
- In a transit cell.

270
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,240
I don't understand.

271
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:24,320
You're on your way to the penal colony
on Cygnus Alpha. Or you will be when the prison ship's refuelled.

272
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,400
Try to look on the bright side.
It must have something.

273
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,720
None of the guests have ever left early.

274
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,480
In fact, none of them have ever left at all.

275
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,200
Why are you going there?

276
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:44,120
They didn't give me a choice. I steal things.
Compulsive, I'm afraid.

277
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:52,280
I've had my head adjusted by some of the best
in the business. But it just won't stay adjusted.

278
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,680
A professional thief?

279
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,040
More a vocation than a profession.
Other people's property comes naturally to me.

280
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,160
What's the time?

281
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,960
Just taking care of it while you were unconscious.
The place is full of criminals.

282
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,560
- Thanks.
- Jenna.

283
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,600
Blake.

284
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,680
What's your story?

285
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,360
I'm innocent.
Of what I was charged with anyway.

286
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,560
We have something in common, then.
All victims of a miscarriage of justice.

287
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,280
- It's true!
- Of course it is.

288
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,960
What about the others?

289
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:31,560
Oh, a very antisocial bunch.
Murderers, liars, cheats...smugglers.

290
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Thieves.

291
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,080
and they're the nice people.

292
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
How long before we take off?

- Blake?

The prosecution evidence was so
complete that I accepted it.

300
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,600
I assumed Blake was guilty and concentrated
on justification and appeals for mercy.

301

Well, what else could you do?
You interviewed all the victims, the witnesses.

302

- None of them had any doubts.
- Perhaps they should have.

there was murdered by Security forces.
